# Plotly Challenge

The goal is to explore and build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Samples.json

Contains all the data used for this project.

## Index.html

Contains the structure of the website and execute the scripts.

## App.js

Creates the plots from the data using Plot.ly and D3.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
